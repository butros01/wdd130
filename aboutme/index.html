    <h2>Butros Kioko</h2>
    <p>My name is Butros Kioko from Nairobi, Kenya in Africa and I am 26 years. I have been a member of the church for about 26 years now since I am a child of record. I have four brother and one beautiful sister. I am not married and currently I have no job. <br>
    I have love for technology and joining BYU Pathway worldwide my desire was to pursue a technology related course and currently I am doing Applied technology degree through BYU-Idaho. <br>
    I have skills in critical thinking and problem solving and that is why I have passion for technology. I like to help people to solve their problem and technology do help people. I have no prior knowledge or experience related to web development but I am always open to learn. <br> Looking forward to achieve more in this course as I widen my job opportunities.</p>
