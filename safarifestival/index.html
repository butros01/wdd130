                <p>
                    Take some time to appreciate the Nature. It's not only the wildlife and the Great Rift-Valley;
                    but also hiking, mountain climbing, and ziplining. It is a wonderful opportunity to get away 
                    from it all and relax in the midst of all the splendor that the great outdoors has to offer 
                    during this Easter Holiday.
