                People will get a chance to visit Maasai Mara National reserve to view wildlife. The Maasai Mara National Reserve 
                is located in southern Kenya, close to the border with Tanzania. It is a protected wilderness region consisting of 
                savannah. It is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including lions, cheetahs, elephants, zebras, and hippos. 
                Throughout the course of their yearly migration, wildebeest travel across its plains. The Mara and Talek rivers 
                run through the middle of the terrain, which consists of grassy plains and undulating hills. Maasai people have 
                established a number of settlements, known as enkangs, in the surrounding region.

                Will have individuals going to the Great Rift Valley view point. The Great Rift Valley, which traverses the whole of Kenya, 
                had a significant role in the formation of many of the country's most recognizable physical characteristics. This particular 
                region of the world is home to a wide variety of natural landscapes, ranging from arid deserts to precipitous cliffs and lakes 
                bordered with algae, with patches of verdant meadows interspersed throughout. In addition to that, there is an abundant amount 
                of animal life in this Valley.
